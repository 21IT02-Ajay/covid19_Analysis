# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights into the pandemic's progression. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to identify infection rates, mortality trends, and recovery statistics.

## Objectives

1.Analyze COVID-19 trends using the covid-19 dataset.

2.Identify key insights regarding infection rates, mortality, and recovery trends.

3.Use visualizations and statistical methods to explore correlations between key variables.

## Dataset

- File: covid-19 / Kaggle Dataset

- Features: country, confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, active cases, and other relevant data points.

## Tools & Technologies

- Programming: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy


## Key Steps in Analysis

- Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and preprocess data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify trends, patterns, and visualize key statistics.

- Correlation & Trend Analysis – Find relationships between infection rates, recovery, and mortality.

- Predictive Modeling (Optional) – Build models to forecast trends if applicable.

## Expected Outcomes

- A deeper understanding of COVID-19 infection trends across different regions.

- Identification of key factors influencing infection rates and mortality.

- Insights into the impact of public health measures on the spread of the virus.

- Data-driven recommendations for future pandemic response and mitigation strategies.

- Visualization of COVID-19 trends for better interpretation by researchers and policymakers.
